### Movie of the Week

_[Left Behind: The Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2528814)_ (2000), directed by Vic Sarin  
[Streaming for free on [IMDB.tv](https://www.imdb.com/tv/watch/tt0190524?ref_=tt_wbr_fdv)]

### Who the Hosts Are This Week

Sam is father of 3 large adult sons, Rayford, Buck, and Dirk. Alissa is a pile of clothes that you find on the airplane seat next to you. (Special guest Natasha is Hattie&#8217;s pantsuit.)

### Special Guest

[Natasha Oladokun](https://twitter.com/NatashaOladokun) is a poet and writer and incredibly overqualified to watch this horrible movie.
