Alissa is the film critic at Vox, author of the upcoming book _[Salty](https://www.broadleafbooks.com/store/product/9781506473550/Salty)_ (coming out June 21, 2022!), and some source code. 

### Other Mentions

- Alissa describes the game (in which Ryan Reynolds' character lives) as a cross between _The Sims_ and _Grand Theft Auto_
- [Aviation Gin](https://www.aviationgin.com/) (which is pretty good, and owned by Ryan Reynolds)
- [_Ready Player One_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720) (which comes to mind because of the huge IP mashup)
- [_How to Train Your Dragon_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892769) (the best movie in which a guy flies on a dragon that came out the same year as _Avatar_)
- [_The Truman Show_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382) (the movie that came to Alissa's mind when watching _Free Guy_)
- David Fincher's movie [_The Game_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119174)
- The Will Ferrell movie [_Stranger than Fiction_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420223)

- David Foster Wallace's novel [_The Broom of the System_](https://bookshop.org/a/20775/9780143129448)
- [_Edge of Tomorrow_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867) (a movie in which the character starts the day over every time he dies)
- Alissa's book [_How to Survive the Apocalypse_](https://bookshop.org/a/20775/9780802872715)
- Sadly, Sam didn't include a list of existential movies in the show notes, so you can still send them to him.

### What we learned today

**Alissa:** There should be more original studio comedies that aren't awful. 

**Sam:** Rather than fighting a given boss over and over again, you should grind to gain XP.
