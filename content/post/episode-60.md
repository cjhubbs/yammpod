### Special Guest

He previously appeared on YAMMPOD [Episode 21](/episode-21) discussing _Babbette's Feast_. (Jeff is in the Scriptorium somewhere, so enthralled by illuminated manuscripts that he doesn't even know the Northmen are coming.)

### Who the Hosts Are This Week

Sam is editor of [Forever Wars](https://foreverwars.substack.com/), film critic at large, editor for hire, and a shepherd who looks exactly like a sheep. Alissa is the film critic at Vox, author of the upcoming book _[Salty](https://www.broadleafbooks.com/store/product/9781506473550/Salty)_, and an interesting 2D drawing of herself.

### What we learned today

**Alissa:** If you find yourself drawing demons on the walls of your house, you should maybe go outside, turn off Twitter, and go eat a hot dog or something.

**Jeffrey:** (_just as a bunch of traffic noise interrupted Sam_) Just as they drew what they loved, what they knew, and where they were into their work, it brings something into this podcast that we know that Sam has spent the entire podcast in traffic with people wondering why he hasn't noticed that the light has changed.

**Sam:** If the foreign visitor can only say one word that you can understand, and that word is "gold!", you don't have to let him in.
