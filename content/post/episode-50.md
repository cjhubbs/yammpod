### What is your takeaway from the movie? 

**Isaac:** Be careful the things you say; children will listen. Be careful the things you do: children will see.

**Alissa:**  
1) You should not abandon your girlfriend even if you become king.  
2) If your mom gives you a green belt with gold woven into it, exercise caution.  
3) Never trust Barry Keoghan ever.  
4) Be honorable, but it&#8217;s OK to not want to be beheaded.  
5) Why are men?

**Sam:** You don&#8217;t have to be awesome. That&#8217;s fine. If you have a girlfriend at the start of the movie, and she seems nice, maybe just stick with that!
