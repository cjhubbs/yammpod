### Other Mentions

  * ["Is Duck Clean Meat?"](https://lifehopeandtruth.com/bible/biblical-laws/clean-and-unclean-animals/is-duck-clean-meat/) (article discussing whether duck is kosher according to the Old Testament. This article wasn't mentioned, but Sam asked whether ducks were mentioned in the Bible and I couldn't resist looking it up. As far as I can tell, ducks are _not_ mentioned in the Bible.)
  * ["_Noah_ and the Jews"](https://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/noah-and-the-jews/) (column in the _Jewish Standard_ about Darren Aronofsky's movie as midrash. Sam and Alissa didn't mention this column but did talk about how this movie pulled a lot from Jewish tradition.)

  * [Calculon](https://futurama.fandom.com/wiki/Calculon) on _[Futurama](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)_
