### Other Mentions

  * [&#8220;Is Duck Clean Meat?&#8221;](https://lifehopeandtruth.com/bible/biblical-laws/clean-and-unclean-animals/is-duck-clean-meat/) (article discussing whether duck is kosher according to the Old Testament. This article wasn&#8217;t mentioned, but Sam asked whether ducks were mentioned in the Bible and I couldn&#8217;t resist looking it up. As far as I can tell, ducks are _not_ mentioned in the Bible.)

Sam and Alissa didn&#8217;t mention this column but did talk about how this movie pulled a lot from Jewish tradition.)
