- The [_Watchmen_](https://bookshop.org/a/20775/9781779501127) comic, of which one of the central questions is whether it's OK to be a genocidal utilitarian if you have superpowers? (This is the second episode in a row Sam has mentioned _Watchmen_... one more and it goes in the penalty box!)

### What we learned today

**Alissa:** There's a fun lesson in here about whether or not you should trust Salma Hayek. (Which would become useful when you go watch _House of Gucci_!)

**Tyler:** Druig was right! When faced with genocide or mind-controlling people, choose mind control. 

**Sam:** After seeing this movie I can no longer describe attractive people as "a snack".
