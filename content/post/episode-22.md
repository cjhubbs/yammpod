### Other Mentions

  * _[The Muppet Christmas Carol](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104940/)_ (which Alissa proclaims is not the best Muppet movie, but is the best movie version of _A Christmas Carol_)
  * _[Call Northside 777](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040202/)_ (another Jimmy Stewart movie that Sam watched frequently as a kid)
  * _[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031679/)_
  * [&#8220;Footprints&#8221; poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprints_(poem)) (whose authorship is apparently disputed)
  * [SNL sketch where they find out Mr. Potter stole the money and beat him up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw89o0afb2A) (Sam mistakenly says that they burn down his house, which I suppose would be hard to do as an SNL skit)
  * [Fry and Laurie sketch where Mr. Potter is Rupert Murdoch](https://abitoffryandlaurie.co.uk/sketches/wonderful_life) 
  * _[A Wonderful Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Wonderful_Life_(film))_ (short drama produced in 1951 by the National Council of Churches)
  * Ray Boltz&#8217; song [&#8220;Thank You&#8221;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=962RR-IEcOU)
  * Thornton Wilder&#8217;s play _[Our Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Town)_
  * [Potter&#8217;s Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potter%27s_field) (reference to [Matthew 27](https://biblehub.com/asv/matthew/27.htm)) I&#8217;m 99% sure that the slums Mr. Potter sets up are actually called &#8220;Pottersville&#8221; in the film, not &#8220;Potter&#8217;s Fields&#8221;, but it&#8217;s still an interesting reference.
  * [Pete Davidson starring in table read](https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/pete-davidson-its-a-wonderful-life-table-read.html) of _It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life_
  * _[Clarence](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099276/)_ (1990 made-for-TV movie starring David Carradine)
