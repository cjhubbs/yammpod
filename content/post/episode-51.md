### Words of Wisdom

**Alissa:** don&#8217;t trick the apple guy out of his apples, and watch _2001: A Space Odyssey_.

**Sam:** If you&#8217;re telling kids Bible stories, leave in as many of the gory parts as you can. They want to know about the blood and Goliath. Don&#8217;t leave out the part where he cut off his head with his own sword. That shit&#8217;s awesome. Also, Ehud stabbed the fat king so far that the fat closed over the wound&#8230; we _loved_ that stuff.<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
