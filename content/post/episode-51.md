### Words of Wisdom

**Alissa:** don't trick the apple guy out of his apples, and watch _2001: A Space Odyssey_.

**Sam:** If you're telling kids Bible stories, leave in as many of the gory parts as you can. They want to know about the blood and Goliath. Don't leave out the part where he cut off his head with his own sword. That shit's awesome. Also, Ehud stabbed the fat king so far that the fat closed over the wound&#8230; we _loved_ that stuff.
