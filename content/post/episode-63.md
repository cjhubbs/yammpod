### What we learned today

**Alissa:** If you want your own spouse to be an actor in your production, you shouldn't tell anyone that you're married until a couple weeks in, and then invite them over for dinner for spicy Korean food.

**Sam:** Invite _me_ over for spicy Korean food. Secondarily: "women drivers, am I right?"
