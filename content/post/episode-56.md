### What we learned today

**Alissa:** There's something significant about a superior alien race that communicates using coffee stains. 

**Sam:** Don't leave your satellite phone unattended.  
  
**Meg:** If we could learn to live in a circle, maybe we'd have less heaven-building and more fullness to life.
