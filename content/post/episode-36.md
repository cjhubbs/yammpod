### Other Mentions

  * _[30 Rock](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496424/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)_ (a show that, per Sam, holds up, and includes Jon Hamm in a short role as a very annoying boyfriend of Liz Lemon&#8217;s)
  * _[Spinning Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9117054/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)_ (a crappy Netflix show about ice skaters which Alissa loves to watch)
  * _[Broadchurch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249364/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)_ (a very sad TV show starring David Tennant)
  * David Tennant&#8217;s run as [The Tenth Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Doctor) on _Doctor Who_
  * Michael Moorcock essay _[Epic Pooh](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/en361fantastika/bibliography/2.7moorcock_m.1978epic_pooh.pdf)_, which suggests that most British fantasy is just &#8220;_Winnie the Pooh_ with swords&#8221;
  * Terry Pratchett&#8217;s _[Discworld](https://bookshop.org/books?keywords=discworld)_ series
  * _[Stranger Things](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)_ (i.e. the scenes about the antichrist which Alissa summarizes as &#8220;what if _Stranger Things_ but boring?&#8221;)
  * _[Paradise Lost](https://bookshop.org/a/20775/9780140424393)_ &#8211; the prototype tale in which a major power/principality is somewhat ambivalent about their role
  * _[Anansi Boys](https://bookshop.org/a/20775/9780062564337)_ (an early, funny novel by Neil Gaiman)
  * [Ken Ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Ham) (the Australian Noah&#8217;s Ark young earth creationism guy)
  * That [Lil Nas X video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6swmTBVI83k)
  * _[Bowling Alone](https://bookshop.org/a/20775/9781982130848)_ (Sam wishes those intense conservative Christians would give up on some of the culture wars and just go bowling&#8230; which I&#8217;m taking as an oblique reference to this book in which author Robert Putnam analyzes the fracturing of American community)
  * John Ganz (sometime NYT columnist and writer)
  * _The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy_ ([book by Douglas Adams](https://bookshop.org/a/20775/9780345391803); also [a BBC radio play](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03v379k); also [a movie starring Mos Def and Martin Freeman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0))
  * The different wills of God (which apparently theologians don&#8217;t agree on the number): RC Sproul wrote about [3 wills](https://www.monergism.com/discerning-god%E2%80%99s-will-three-wills-god); John Piper talks about [2 wills](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/are-there-two-wills-in-god).
  * [The Metatron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron#:~:text=In%20folkloristic%20tradition%2C%20he%20is,his%20transformation%20into%20an%20angel.)

  * _[Battlestar Galactica](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407362/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)_ (always good for a random quote)
