### Other Mentions

Lots of discussion specifically about the show, not too many references out, but there are still some&#8230;

  * _Tweeto ergo sum_
  * The director's cut of _[Doctor Sleep](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5606664)_ (which apparently is a lot better movie than the original cut, and another movie by _Midnight Mass_ director Mike Flanagan)
  * _[Higher Ground](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1562568/)_ (a movie [reviewed previously on YAMMPOD](https://yammpod.info/episode-14/), which _Midnight Mass_ might resemble if it wasn't full of <spoilers>)
  * [Opus Dei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_Dei)
  * _[Saint Maud](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7557108/)_ (another movie that resonates with this one, discussed on [YAMMPOD #43](https://yammpod.info/episode-43/))
  * [The Rifleman's Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman%27s_Creed) from _Full Metal Jacket_
  * [Paul Pressler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pressler_(politician)) & [Paige Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paige_Patterson)
  * _[Schmigadoon!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11808942/)_ (a fun little musical comedy that has a Bev character played by Kristin Chenowith)
  * Sam suggests that this show is the prequel to _[True Blood](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844441/)_
  * Mike Flanagan's [essay about _Midnight Mass_](https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3684646/deeply-personal-horror-midnight-mass-guest-essay-filmmaker-mike-flanagan/) at Bloody-Disgusting.com
  * Some good lessons could be learned from _[Zombieland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156398/)_

### What is the moral to this story?

Alissa: If you go to church regularly and you take communion and discover that you no longer need glasses, or that your wrinkles are disappearing, or that you're less grey, you should back away slowly and go somewhere else. Find some Episcopalians or something! Also, blood is important.

Andy: #1: ACAV (All Catholics Are <spoilers>). #2: Buy some damn As for your church sign. Especially if you're having AA meetings! #3: I want to see Hamish Linklater in a Nick Cave biopic, ASAP.

Sam: If you live on an island, at least have a speedboat, or have an escape route.
