### Who the Hosts Are This Week

Sam is editor of [Forever Wars](https://foreverwars.substack.com/), reporter-at-large, critic for hire, and inchoate ball of smugness. Alissa is the film critic at Vox, author of the upcoming book _[Salty](https://www.broadleafbooks.com/store/product/9781506473550/Salty)_, and a teeny-tiny piece of a giant comet headed straight for Earth.

### What we learned today

**Alissa:** Blonde ladies are not to be trusted. Also, something about office snacks.

**Sam:** The president of your cell phone carrier is probably more powerful than the president.
