### What We Learned Today

**Alissa:** If you have creepy, demon-possessed paraphenelia in your house... don't put it there. You should just get rid of it. There are also any number of types of houses that the movies have taught us we should not be buying and moving our family into. 
**Sam:** Sheet ghosts can be scary.
**Mason:** Don't ever let the Catholic church tell you what you can or cannot do.
