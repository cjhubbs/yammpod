### Movie of the Week

_[A Charlie Brown Christmas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2528814)_ (1965), directed by Bill Melendez  
[Currently only available with a subscription to Apple TV+]

### Who the Hosts Are This Week

Sam is a half goat, half demon creature who punishes naughty children at Christmas. Alissa is the angel on top of the Christmas tree... or maybe she's Santa.

### Special Guest

Emily VanDerWerff is a critic at Vox, the first TV editor of The AV Club, co-author of _[Monsters of the Week: The Complete Critical Companion to The X-Files](https://bookshop.org/a/20775/9781419738036)_, and host of the mystery-comedy podcastÂ _[Arden](https://www.ardenpodcast.com/)_. (Emily says she is Sally Brown, the materialist screaming for tens and twenties.)
